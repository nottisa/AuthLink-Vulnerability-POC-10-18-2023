# AuthLink-Vulnerability-POC-10-18-2023
POC AuthLink Guilded Exploit made by @nottisa on Guilded https://guilded.gg/u/isa </br>
This vulnerability exploits the lack of a cooldown in order to spam a certain user, a group of users, or possibly to bring down Authlink for all other users either by rate-limiting Authlink or by getting blocked by the Guilded API. </br>
I've gone ahead and labeled this exploit as Medium as it cannot directly cause harm or collect personally identifiable information.

npm i axios
node main.js
